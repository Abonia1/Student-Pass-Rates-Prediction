# Regression Analysis_Success rate of high school

## Introduction

In this Project:
Introduction: Pass Rate - Linear Regression Project
In this notebook, we will implement a complete machine learning project, walk through the whole machine learning process, cleaning up the data, exploring it for trends, establishing a basic model, by evaluating several machine learning approaches for comparisons, by interpreting the results, and presenting the results, proposals for improvement (model, data enrichment ...).
## Installation
* Python 3.5 
* Scikit-learn (1.20.1)
* Imbalanced-learn(0.7.0)
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* pymysql
* Matplotlib
* [Dataset](data.gouv.fr)

## Running
### To install dependencies:
1. First install the required depedencies and run 
`pip install -r requirment.txt`


## Algorithms Used
   * XGBoost Regressor
   * SVM Regressor
   * Linear Regressor
   * ElasticNet Regressor
   * Random Forest Regressor
   * Extra Tree Regressor



## Future Work

1. Dataset preprocessing must be improved further to produce better result.

2. Using only the top best important features with algorithm can improve model performance

3. Use different parameter with different values can also improve the model performance in future
